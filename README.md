# Welcome to 9620728 Programming Portfolio

## Programing 1 Semester 1 Projects:

### OOP Calculator

Graphic based OOP calculator

[Source Code](https://github.com/9620728/computer-programing1/upload/main/src/Calculator](https://github.com/9620728/computer-programing1/tree/main/src))

This was a coding project where we had to make a calculator and it was really fun but that most annoying part of this project where placing the buttons down on the screen. We had to place each sqaure on a certain point in space and it was really annoying.


### SpaceGame

One of the most fun ones, it was really entertainting to make and to play with at the end of the coding.
### Screen Saver


### Cars

A really cute little project with small little cars on the screen driving around.
**### Shape Tester

![Source Code](https://github.com/9620728/computer-programing1/tree/main/src/shapes)

This was a project to help us get better at basic coding and for us to understand how to code.
### TempConv

![Source Code](https://github.com/9620728/computer-programing1/tree/main/src/TempConverter)

This was a project that helped us expand our thoughs of coding and out basic knowlegde of coding.
